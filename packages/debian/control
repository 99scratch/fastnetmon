Description: Very fast DDoS analyzer with sflow/netflow/mirror support
FastNetMon - A high performance DoS/DDoS load analyzer built on top of multiple packet capture engines (NetFlow, IPFIX, sFLOW, netmap, PF_RING, PCAP).

What can we do? We can detect hosts in our own network with a large amount of packets per second/bytes per second or flow per second incoming or outgoing from certain hosts. And we can call an external script which can notify you, switch off a server or blackhole the client.

Features:
- Can process incoming and outgoing traffic
- Can trigger block script if certain IP loads network with a large amount of packets/bytes/flows per second
- Could announce blocked IPs to BGP router with ExaBGP
- Have integration with Graphite
- netmap support (open source; wire speed processing; only Intel hardware NICs or any hypervisor VM type)
- Supports L2TP decapsulation, VLAN untagging and MPLS processing in mirror mode
- Can work on server/soft-router
- Can detect DoS/DDoS in 1-2 seconds
- Tested up to 10GE with 12 Mpps on Intel i7 3820 with Intel NIC 82599
- Complete plugin support
- Have complete support for most popular attack types
